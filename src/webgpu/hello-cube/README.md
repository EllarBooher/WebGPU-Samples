# WebGPU Hello Cube

Displays a simple spinning cube, shaded with uv coordinates that run from `(0,0,0)` from one corner to `(1,1,1)` on the other. The UI panel displays which WebGPU features are supported by the loaded instance. Since WebGPU instances only enumerate their supported features instead of all valid features, the list is manually updated and may be out of date.
