# WebGPU Samples

This repository hosts samples of WebGPU I've made in Typescript, alongside React components to display them and their associated READMEs. This project is tailor-made for my use in embedding in my portfolio website, currently hosted at <https://ellarbooher.github.io/> and with a repository at <https://github.com/EllarBooher/EllarBooher.github.io>.
